icfp.exe: Instant Checker For Publications

I'm so sick of the reviewers rejecting my perfectly good publications
for no reason at all.  I reverse-engineered and automated their review
process falderal: if you run this program on your publications, it will
tell you whether or not they'll be accepted.

And, with the time the TRB is taking to review tenure cases these days,
our new administrators won't get their credentials until who knows when.
So this program will grant administrative privileges if it decides that
your publication record has enough gravitas.
